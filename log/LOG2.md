# **100 days of machine learning code 2**

## **`To-Do`**

Within the period of 100 days i would learn enough machine learning concepts both theory and practicals to be competent in the subject area. i would employ the use of two practical text books and an online course to prepare myself.

## **`Resources`**

The following resources would be used through out the 100 days:

**`Books`**
- 1. Introduction to statistical learning.

- 2. Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow

**`Course`**
- 1. [Introduction to machine learning](https://www.fast.ai/)(fastai)

**`Data Repositories`**

- 1. [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)

- 2. [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
