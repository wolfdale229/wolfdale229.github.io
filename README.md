Hi my name is Omefe Chika and I am an aspiring Artificial Intellgence/ Machine learning developer.
 
This page is a medium to share my machine learning/deep learning projects, little notes of what i have learnt so far and resources for those that want to get into the field of machine learning. To view my projects check my <a href="http://github.com/wolfdale229" target="_blank">github page</a>

If you would like to learn more about machine learning in a simplified way check out my [Blog Post](Notes.md). 

If you are ever wondering how to get into making machine learning/deep learning softwares, here is a framework i have created for myself (Note : it assumes some familarity with python programming language and dedication to read and practice every material presented)[ml/dl framework](framework.md)
