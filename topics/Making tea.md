## Topics : Resources for machine learning for beginners.

Half way through my **#100daysofmlcodes** and  after going through several posts on how to learn machine learning, i have come up with a list of books and tutorials that would benefit anyone interested in machine learning and how to develop machine learning softwares. This list assumes you are familiar with python and are willing to learn libraries like numpy, pandas and matplotlib.

The list is made of three sections.
>	
	1. Machine learning 
	2. Software development
	3. Deep learning

## Software Development.
Python programming language is one of the top leading programming languages that has seen steady increase in it's use and it can be used in virtually any field. Python offers users the ease of developing production ready software without putting to much stress on the programmer. There are several good introductory python out there which anyone can learn the laguage from but concepts like Algorithms and Object-Oriented programming which are important in software development are not always taught. Reading the following books would help in taking your programming skills to the next level.

>
	1. Practical Programming_ An Introduction to Computer Science Using Python 3.6 
	2. Python 3 Object-Oriented Programming
	3. Grokking Algorithms - An illustrated guide for programmers and other curious.

## Machine Learning
Machine learning, the use of data and algorithms to predict future occurances is a very interesting field to get into right now and the increase in several MOOC platforms have made it even easier for non-computer-science students to get into the field. If you were to Google the word `machine learning book` or `machine learning course` you would be presented with hundreds of web sites and books about the field. After going through some courses and books, here are some of the ones i personally like.

### BOOKS
>
	1. Machine Learning for Absolute Beginners by Oliver Theobald 
	2. The hundred-page machine learning book by Andriy Burkov
	3. Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn  Keras  and TensorFlow by Aurélien Géron
	4. Real-World Machine Learning by Henrik Brink, Joseph Richards, Mark Fetherolf

### Courses
>	
	1. Complete Machine Learning and Data Science: Zero to Mastery by Andrei Neagoie and Daniel Bourke
	2. Introduction to machine learning (fastai)

## Deep Learning
'Deep learning represents an exciting intersection of machine learning and artificial intelligence, and a very significant disruption to society and industry'. I would present several books and courses that focuses on the top two libraries that have seen steady use in the deep learning world with are **TensorFlow** and **Pytorch**. Feel free to start with any of the libraries by I started with pytorch has it offered the easiest entry into deep learning. Reading **`Grokking Deep Learning by Andrew W. Trask`** first would give you the need intuition about deep learning

### BOOKS
>
	1. Deep-Learning-with-PyTorch by Eli Stevens, Luca Antiga,and Thomas Viehmann.
	2. Deep learning for coders with pytorch and fastai by jeremy howard et el.
	3. Programming PyTorch for Deep Learning Creating and Deploying Deep Learning  by Ian Pointer
	4. Deep Learning with Python by Francois Chollet
	5. Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn  Keras  and TensorFlow by Aurélien Géron

### COURSES
>
	1. Deep learning for coders (fastai).
	2. MIT introduction to deep learning.
        3. Udacity deep learning with Tensorflow.

So after going through all this would I be a machine learning superstar? as with art of tea making, practice makes perfection, try your hands on more data sets, create something new, contribute to open source and be open to changes.
