#About

### The is a generic about page 
`I make YouTube videos and write about the crossover of health, technology and art.
I'm the machine learning instructor for the Zero to Mastery Academy.
My (current) mission is to use AI to help people move more and eat better.
My ikigai (Japanese word for ‘reason for being’) is learning to create and creating to learn.
I've been a machine learning engineer at Max Kelsen, Uber Driver, Genius at Apple, fitness coach and men's physique competitor in that order.
In 2017, I decided to start teaching myself to code, with a focus on machine learning and artificial intelligence via my self-created Artificial Intelligence Masters Degree.
My writing is available on Medium, Quora and here.
Every month or so, I send out a newsletter called Eat, Move, Learn, Make detailing my work. Why Eat, Move, Learn, Make? These are the things I like doing most.
Making and movement are two non-negotiable daily rituals for me.
